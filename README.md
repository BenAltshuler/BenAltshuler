ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BenAltshuler


Iâ€™m a data and stats enthusiast who loves executing exploratory data analysis and gleaning actionable insights using tools like Pandas, Spark, SQL, R, and PyTorch.
I enjoy wrangling the complexity out of overwhelming sets of info, and presenting my findings in a way anyone can understand. 

I also collect vintage guitars, pedals, amplifiers, and hifi speakers, so I'm always down to chat about gear!
